# Taskflow

**Task tracking for keeping your team coordinated.**

This is the older repository used for the original website deployment to Cloudflare Pages. 
A new repository has been created for the migration to Cloudflare Workers, 
which can be found [here](https://github.com/cockatoo-dev/taskflow).

The website deployment on Cloudflare Pages remains online, and can be found at 
[https://taskflow-webapp.pages.dev/](https://taskflow-webapp.pages.dev/).
Both this website deployment and the website deployment on Cloudflare Workers use the same 
database, and all your existing boards and tasks will appear on the new website deployment.
Users are encouraged to begin using the website deployment on Cloudflare Workers, which can be found at 
[https://taskflow.cockatoo-dev.workers.dev](https://taskflow.cockatoo-dev.workers.dev).
