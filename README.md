## Libraries and frameworks used

Taskflow is made using Vue 3, Nuxt 3, Nuxt UI v2, Tailwind CSS v3, Chart.js (via vue-chartjs) and Drizzle ORM.

## Branch information

This is the branch for a planned migration to newer versions of some key libraries and frameworks used by Taskflow. Work will likely begin later in 2025 when all of the libraries and frameworks have either released their new versions, or are very close to doing so.

Planned updates:
- Nuxt v4 - release date unknown, can use some backported features in Nuxt v3
- Nuxt UI v3 - now in alpha
- Tailwind CSS v4 - released!
- Drizzle ORM v1 - release date unknown
- nuxt-auth-utils v1 - release date unknown
- Newer minor/patch versions of all other libraries and frameworks used.
